# commit

- analyse local changes
- add new untracked files
- delete and extraneous files (or potentially .gitignore them)
  - if you are unsure, ask the user 
- brutally critique them, but don't be pedantic
- if the quality not ok, explain why, be clear and helpful
- if it's largely ok, write a nice and detailed commit message and commit
    - if you are unsure, ask the user
