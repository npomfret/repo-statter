# Phase 6: Testing Strategy & Release

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Phase 6 is **100% implemented** with practical automation for a personal project.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### Core Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with coverage reporting
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for critical paths
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Quality gates before commits (`pnpm quality:check`)

### Quality Gates
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint checks
- Unit test execution
- Build verification
- Package version consistency

### Automation Scripts
- **Bundle Size Monitoring**: Track package sizes (`pnpm size:check`)
- **Release Notes**: Auto-generate from commits (`pnpm release:notes`)
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Optional performance tracking (`pnpm bench`)
- **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive pre-release checks (`pnpm quality:check`)

## ðŸ“‹ Key Scripts

```bash
# Daily Development
pnpm test              # Run tests
pnpm lint              # Check code quality
pnpm build             # Build packages
pnpm quality:check     # Run all quality gates

# Optional Tools
pnpm bench             # Performance benchmarks
pnpm size:check        # Monitor bundle sizes
pnpm release:notes     # Generate changelog
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Simple Quality Checks

1. **Tests Pass**: Unit tests run successfully
2. **Build Works**: TypeScript compiles without errors
3. **Lint Clean**: No ESLint violations
4. **Packages Aligned**: Version consistency across monorepo

## ðŸš€ What's Actually Useful

For a personal project, the following are genuinely helpful:

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Catch issues before they're committed
- **Basic CI**: Tests run on push/PR (GitHub Actions configured)
- **Bundle monitoring**: Know if packages get bloated
- **Release notes**: Track what changed between versions

## âœ¨ Recent Enhancements

- Enhanced pre-commit hook to run full quality validation
- Added bundle size monitoring with practical limits
- Created release notes generator for changelog
- Added performance benchmarking (optional)
- Integrated all checks into CI pipeline

**Phase 6 Status**: Complete âœ…

The project now has sensible automation without enterprise overhead.
