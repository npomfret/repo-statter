# Code Complexity Metrics

## Idea
Integrate tools to calculate and track code complexity (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Complexity) for files or functions over time, providing insights into maintainability and potential refactoring needs.

## Implementation Suggestions

### 1. Complexity Analysis Tool Integration
- **External Tools:** Integrate with existing code complexity analysis tools. For JavaScript/TypeScript, this could involve running `escomplex` or `jscomplexity` as a child process.
- **Language Agnostic Approach:** For other languages, consider using a more generic approach like parsing ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) if a suitable library exists, or relying on language-specific CLI tools.
- **Execution:** Run the complexity analysis on relevant files at each commit (or periodically) to track changes over time.

### 2. Data Collection & Storage
- **Per-File/Per-Function Metrics:** Store complexity metrics for each analyzed file and, if possible, for individual functions within those files.
- **Historical Data:** Augment `CommitData` or create a new data structure to store historical complexity values, allowing for trend analysis.
- **`repo-stats.json` Extension:** Include complexity data in the generated JSON output.

### 3. Reporting & Visualization
- **Complexity Trends:** Chart the average complexity of the codebase over time, or for specific modules/files.
- **Top N Complex Files/Functions:** List the most complex files or functions, highlighting those that exceed predefined thresholds.
- **Complexity vs. Churn:** Visualize the relationship between code complexity and code churn. High complexity + high churn often indicates a problematic area.
- **Complexity Distribution:** Use histograms or box plots to show the distribution of complexity across the codebase.
- **Threshold Highlighting:** Visually flag files or functions that exceed acceptable complexity thresholds in the report.

## Impact
- Helps identify "hot spots" in the codebase that are difficult to understand, test, or maintain.
- Guides refactoring efforts by pinpointing areas with high technical debt.
- Provides objective metrics for code quality and maintainability.
- Can be used to track the effectiveness of refactoring initiatives over time.
