# Enhanced Interactive Filtering

## Idea
Allow more complex filtering combinations (e.g., author AND date range AND file type) and drill-down capabilities (e.g., click a file type to see related commits) directly within the generated HTML report.

## Implementation Suggestions

### 1. Frontend Data Management
- **Client-side Data Store:** Ensure all necessary data (commits, contributors, file types, etc.) is loaded into JavaScript variables on the client-side when the report is generated. This is largely already done.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Use JavaScript Maps or Objects for quick lookups and filtering.

### 2. Advanced Filter UI
- **Combined Filters:** Implement a UI that allows users to combine multiple filter criteria (e.g., author dropdown, date range pickers, file type multi-select, commit message keyword search).
- **Logical Operators:** Potentially allow `AND`/`OR` logic between different filter types.
- **Filter Summary:** Display a clear summary of the currently applied filters.

### 3. Dynamic Chart Updates
- **Re-render on Filter Change:** When filters are applied, re-calculate the underlying data for all charts and re-render them dynamically using ApexCharts API methods (e.g., `updateSeries`, `updateOptions`).
- **Data Recalculation:** The `recalculateData` function in `src/report/template.html` (within the script tag) will need to be extended to handle all new filter combinations and recalculate `filteredCommits`, `filteredContributors`, etc., based on the active filters.

### 4. Drill-down Capabilities
- **Clickable Chart Elements:** Make elements within charts (e.g., a bar in the contributor chart, a slice in the file type donut) clickable.
- **Contextual Filtering:** When a chart element is clicked, apply a filter based on that element's data. For example:
    - Clicking an author in the contributor chart filters the entire report to show only that author's commits.
    - Clicking a file type in the donut chart filters to show only commits affecting that file type.
    - Clicking a point on a time-series chart could filter to commits around that date.
- **Breadcrumbs/Filter Stack:** Implement a way to show the active drill-down path and allow users to easily go back or remove specific drill-down filters.

### 5. Performance Considerations
- **Debouncing:** For text input filters (like commit message search), debounce the input to avoid excessive re-rendering.
- **Web Workers (Advanced):** For very large repositories, consider offloading heavy data recalculations to web workers to keep the UI responsive.

## Impact
- Significantly improves the utility and interactivity of the generated reports.
- Allows users to quickly explore specific aspects of the repository data.
- Enhances data discovery and insights by enabling targeted analysis.
- Makes the report a more powerful analytical tool rather than just a static display.
