# Chart System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Time Slider Zoom Sync Issue
**Problem**: The time slider was trying to zoom user activity charts, which use daily aggregated data. This caused display issues when zooming to narrow time ranges.

**Solution**: Excluded user activity charts from the time slider zoom synchronization. Only user line charts are now zoomed.

### 2. Word Cloud Data Format Compatibility
**Problem**: The word cloud chart validation was expecting `word` and `count` properties, but the actual data used `text` and `size` properties, causing all data to be filtered out as invalid.

**Solution**: Updated the word cloud data formatter to handle both data formats correctly, normalizing them to a consistent format.

### 3. File Type Filtering for Charts
**Problem**: When selecting a file type filter, many charts (growth, category lines, commit activity) were not updating because they use pre-calculated time series data that doesn't include file type information.

**Solution**: 
- Charts that can be filtered (file heatmap, top files) continue to work
- Charts that need pre-calculated data now show a user-friendly message explaining that filtering is not yet supported
- All charts properly restore when the filter is cleared

## Technical Details

### Chart Migration Progress
- âœ… Simple charts migrated (contributors, file types, word cloud, file heatmap, commit activity)
- âœ… Axis toggle charts migrated (growth, category lines) with unified toggle system
- ðŸ”„ Complex charts still need migration (top files, time slider, user charts)

### Known Limitations
1. File type filtering requires recalculating time series and linear series data, which is not yet implemented
2. The top files chart is complex with 3 variants and needs special handling during migration
3. User charts are dynamically created and need their own migration approach

## Next Steps
1. Complete migration of remaining complex charts
2. Implement proper data recalculation for file type filtering
3. Remove old chart implementation
4. Final integration testing
