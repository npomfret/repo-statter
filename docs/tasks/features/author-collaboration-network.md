# Author Collaboration Network

## Idea
Visualize how different contributors interact by showing connections between authors who frequently modify the same files or modules, revealing collaboration patterns and potential knowledge silos.

## Implementation Suggestions

### 1. Co-authorship Detection
- **Commit-level Co-occurrence:** For each commit, identify all files changed. Then, for every pair of authors who have committed to the *same file* (not necessarily in the same commit, but over time), increment a collaboration score between them.
- **Time-based Proximity:** Optionally, weight the collaboration score based on the temporal proximity of their commits to the same files (e.g., commits to the same file within a week count more).
- **Module-level Co-occurrence:** Extend the concept to modules/directories. If two authors frequently commit to files within the same module, their collaboration score increases.

### 2. Network Graph Data Generation
- **Nodes:** Each author is a node in the network graph.
- **Edges:** An edge exists between two authors if their collaboration score exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Edge Weight:** The thickness or color of the edge represents the strength of their collaboration (the collaboration score).
- **Node Size/Color:** Node size could represent the total number of commits by an author, and color could represent their primary area of contribution (e.g., based on file types they mostly work on).

### 3. Reporting & Visualization
- **Interactive Force-Directed Graph:** Use a JavaScript library like D3.js or vis.js to render an interactive force-directed graph in the HTML report.
    - Nodes should be draggable.
    - Hovering over a node should highlight its connections.
    - Clicking a node could filter the report to show only commits by that author or their collaborators.
- **Collaboration Metrics:** Display metrics like:
    - **Centrality:** Identify highly connected authors (key collaborators).
    - **Clustering:** Detect groups of authors who work closely together.
    - **Bridging Authors:** Identify authors who connect otherwise disparate groups.
- **Top Collaboration Pairs:** List the top N pairs of authors with the highest collaboration scores.

## Impact
- Reveals informal team structures and collaboration patterns.
- Helps identify potential single points of failure (knowledge silos).
- Can inform team restructuring or knowledge transfer initiatives.
- Provides insights into onboarding effectiveness for new team members.
