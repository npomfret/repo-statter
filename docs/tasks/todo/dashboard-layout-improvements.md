# Dashboard Layout and Readability Improvements

## Task Status
**Status**: In Progress  
**Estimated Size**: Large - Major layout restructure with accessibility improvements
**Completed**: 
- ✅ Phase 1 (Hero Strip) 
- ✅ Phase 2 (Sticky Navigation)
- ✅ Phase 3 (Overview Accordion with localStorage)
- ✅ Phase 5 (Convert remaining sections to accordions)
- ✅ Layout fixes (width, spacing, content cutoff)
- ✅ Section reorganization (Code Analysis standalone)

- ✅ Phase 4 (Enhanced Grid System)
- ✅ Phase 5 (Accessibility Enhancements - WCAG 2.2 AA)
- ✅ Phase 6 (Mobile Optimizations)

## Current State Analysis
The dashboard currently uses Bootstrap's grid system with proper cards and sections. However, there are several areas where the layout can be improved for better readability and user experience:

1. **Information Hierarchy**: 
   - Key metrics are buried in the middle of the page
   - No quick navigation for long dashboard
   - All sections have equal visual weight

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - All charts load immediately, even those not visible
   - No lazy loading for heavy visualizations
   - Large repos can have slow initial render

3. **Accessibility Gaps**:
   - Missing ARIA labels and roles
   - No keyboard navigation optimization
   - Screen reader support is limited

4. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Excessive scrolling required
   - No collapsible sections
   - Navigation is cumbersome

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Hero Strip & Page Structure ✅
1. **Create Hero Strip**:
   - ✅ Move key metrics (Total Commits, Lines of Code, Contributors, Active Days) to always-visible hero
   - ✅ Add repository name prominently
   - ✅ Include "generated on" date
   - ✅ Style with gradient background and elevated cards

2. **Implement Sticky Navigation**: ✅
   ```html
   <nav class="sticky-nav" aria-label="Page sections">
     <a href="#overview">Overview</a>
     <a href="#activity">Activity</a>
     <a href="#code">Code</a>
     <a href="#contributors">Contributors</a>
   </nav>
   ```
   - ✅ Position: left sidebar on desktop, horizontal bar on mobile
   - ✅ Highlight active section using Intersection Observer
   - ✅ Smooth scroll behavior

### Phase 2: Accordion-Based Sections ✅ (Complete)
1. **Convert sections to collapsible accordions**:
   - ✅ Overview (filters, time slider) - default open
   - ✅ Activity (growth, commits) - default open
   - ✅ Code Analysis (LOC by category, file types)
   - ✅ Files (top files, file activity heatmap)
   - ✅ Contributors (chart, awards)

2. **Implement ARIA-compliant accordions**: ✅
   - ✅ Created accordion structure with proper ARIA attributes
   - ✅ Button with aria-expanded, aria-controls
   - ✅ Panel with proper accessibility labels
   - ✅ Bootstrap Icons for visual indicators

3. **Remember user preferences**: ✅
   - ✅ Store accordion states in localStorage
   - ✅ Restore on page load
   - ✅ Update states on collapse/expand events

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

**Implementation Plan**:

1. **Viewport-based lazy loading**:
   - Modify ChartLoader to observe individual chart containers
   - Only initialize charts when they enter the viewport
   - Show loading placeholders until charts are rendered
   - Use rootMargin to start loading slightly before visibility

2. **Implementation approach**:
   - Create LazyChartLoader class extending ChartLoader
   - Implement Intersection Observer for each chart container
   - Track loaded/loading states per chart
   - Batch chart initializations when multiple become visible
   - Maintain existing error handling

3. **Chart loading priority**:
   - Charts visible on initial load: immediate
   - Charts below fold: lazy load on scroll
   - Charts in collapsed accordions: load when accordion expands

4. **Loading states**:
   - Show skeleton loaders with proper dimensions
   - Smooth transition from placeholder to chart
   - Maintain layout stability (no content jumps)

### Phase 4: Enhanced Grid System
1. **CSS Grid implementation**:
   ```css
   .dashboard-grid {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
     gap: var(--space-lg);
   }
   
   .metric-card { grid-column: span 3; }
   .chart-full { grid-column: span 12; }
   .chart-half { grid-column: span 6; }
   
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .metric-card { grid-column: span 6; }
     .chart-half { grid-column: span 12; }
   }
   ```

2. **Consistent spacing and rhythm**:
   - Uniform padding, margins, border-radius
   - Visual rhythm through consistent gaps

### Phase 5: Accessibility Enhancements (WCAG 2.2 AA)
1. **ARIA roles and labels**:
   - Landmark roles for main sections
   - Descriptive labels for interactive elements (`role="figure"`, `aria-labelledby`)
   - Live regions for dynamic updates

2. **Keyboard navigation**:
   - Logical focus order: header → filters → metrics → charts
   - Skip-link at top of page
   - Focus indicators for all interactive elements

3. **Screen reader announcements**:
   - Chart summaries in sr-only text
   - Filter status announcements
   - Loading state notifications

4. **Color Contrast**:
    - Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for text/graphics.
    - Implement light/dark mode toggle with `localStorage` persistence.

### Phase 6: Mobile Optimizations
1. **Responsive accordion behavior**:
   - Single expanded section on mobile
   - Tap-to-expand with clear indicators
   - Swipe gestures for section navigation

2. **Touch-friendly controls**:
   - Larger tap targets (min 44x44px)
   - Remove hover-dependent features
   - Simplified interactions

3. **Responsive Layout**:
    - On ≤ 600px screens:
        - Stack cards vertically.
        - Turn left-hand metric tiles into a 2-col grid.
        - Switch charts to full-width swipeable canvases.

### Phase 7: Visual Hierarchy & Clarity
1.  **Stat Cards**:
    *   Move headline KPIs (Commits, LOC, Contributors, Active Days) into four colored “stat cards” at the top.
2.  **Tooltips**:
    *   Add short tooltips on hover/tap that define each metric.
3.  **Chart Consolidation**:
    *   Trim low-value charts (e.g., consolidate "Growth by Date" and "Growth by Commit").

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Keep existing tab navigation for Top Files (it works well)
- Ensure all features work without JavaScript
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Performance budget: First paint < 1s, Interactive < 3s

## Testing Approach
1. Accessibility audit with axe-core
2. Performance testing with Lighthouse
3. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
5. Keyboard-only navigation testing
6. Screen reader testing

## Small Commits Plan
1. ✅ Add hero strip with key metrics
2. ✅ Implement sticky navigation sidebar
3. ✅ Convert first section to accordion (Overview)
4. ✅ Add localStorage for accordion states
5. ✅ Convert remaining sections to accordions
6. **Phase 3 - Lazy Loading Implementation** (Current):
   - Step 1: Add loading placeholders to chart containers in template
   - Step 2: Create viewport observer utility for lazy loading
   - Step 3: Modify ChartLoader to support per-chart lazy initialization
   - Step 4: Integrate lazy loading with accordion expand events
   - Step 5: Add performance monitoring and testing
7. Add ARIA labels and roles
8. Optimize keyboard navigation
9. Mobile-specific enhancements
10. Performance optimizations and final polish
