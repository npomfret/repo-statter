## Notes

The top files chart is complex because:
1. It's actually 3 separate charts (size, churn, complexity)
2. Each chart needs file type filtering
3. Data needs to be recalculated when filter changes
4. Complexity view depends on external lizard tool

User charts are complex because:
1. They are dynamically created for each contributor
2. They have their own axis toggle system
3. They need special handling in time slider zoom
