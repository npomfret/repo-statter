# Dashboard Layout and Readability Improvements

## Task Status
**Status**: In Progress  
**Estimated Size**: Large - Major layout restructure with accessibility improvements
**Completed**: 
- ✅ Phase 1 (Hero Strip) 
- ✅ Phase 2 (Sticky Navigation)
- ✅ Phase 3 (Overview Accordion with localStorage)
- ✅ Phase 5 (Convert remaining sections to accordions)
- ✅ Layout fixes (width, spacing, content cutoff)
- ✅ Section reorganization (Code Analysis standalone)

## Current State Analysis
The dashboard currently uses Bootstrap's grid system with proper cards and sections. However, there are several areas where the layout can be improved for better readability and user experience:

1. **Information Hierarchy**: 
   - Key metrics are buried in the middle of the page
   - No quick navigation for long dashboard
   - All sections have equal visual weight

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - All charts load immediately, even those not visible
   - No lazy loading for heavy visualizations
   - Large repos can have slow initial render

3. **Accessibility Gaps**:
   - Missing ARIA labels and roles
   - No keyboard navigation optimization
   - Screen reader support is limited

4. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Excessive scrolling required
   - No collapsible sections
   - Navigation is cumbersome

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Hero Strip & Page Structure ✅
1. **Create Hero Strip**:
   - ✅ Move key metrics (Total Commits, Lines of Code, Contributors, Active Days) to always-visible hero
   - ✅ Add repository name prominently
   - ✅ Include "generated on" date
   - ✅ Style with gradient background and elevated cards

2. **Implement Sticky Navigation**: ✅
   ```html
   <nav class="sticky-nav" aria-label="Page sections">
     <a href="#overview">Overview</a>
     <a href="#activity">Activity</a>
     <a href="#code-analysis">Code</a>
     <a href="#files">Files</a>
     <a href="#contributors">Contributors</a>
   </nav>
   ```
   - ✅ Position: left sidebar on desktop, horizontal bar on mobile
   - ✅ Highlight active section using Intersection Observer
   - ✅ Smooth scroll behavior

### Phase 2: Accordion-Based Sections ✅ (Complete)
1. **Convert sections to collapsible accordions**:
   - ✅ Overview (filters, time slider) - default open
   - ✅ Activity (growth, commits) - default open  
   - ✅ Code Analysis (LOC by category, file types)
   - ✅ Files (top files, file activity heatmap)
   - ✅ Contributors (chart, awards)

2. **Implement ARIA-compliant accordions**: ✅
   - ✅ Created accordion structure with proper ARIA attributes
   - ✅ Button with aria-expanded, aria-controls
   - ✅ Panel with proper accessibility labels
   - ✅ Bootstrap Icons for visual indicators

3. **Remember user preferences**: ✅
   - ✅ Store accordion states in localStorage
   - ✅ Restore on page load
   - ✅ Update states on collapse/expand events

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
1. **Lazy load chart libraries**:
   - Load ApexCharts only when needed
   - Defer D3.js until word cloud is visible
   - Show loading skeletons while charts render

2. **Intersection Observer for charts**:
   ```typescript
   const chartObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
     entries.forEach(entry => {
       if (entry.isIntersecting) {
         loadChart(entry.target.id);
         chartObserver.unobserve(entry.target);
       }
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Progressive enhancement**:
   - Basic HTML structure works without JS
   - Enhance with interactivity when JS loads

### Phase 4: Enhanced Grid System
1. **CSS Grid implementation**:
   ```css
   .dashboard-grid {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
     gap: var(--space-lg);
   }
   
   .metric-card { grid-column: span 3; }
   .chart-full { grid-column: span 12; }
   .chart-half { grid-column: span 6; }
   
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .metric-card { grid-column: span 6; }
     .chart-half { grid-column: span 12; }
   }
   ```

2. **Consistent spacing and rhythm**:
   - Uniform padding, margins, border-radius
   - Visual rhythm through consistent gaps

### Phase 5: Accessibility Enhancements
1. **ARIA roles and labels**:
   - Landmark roles for main sections
   - Descriptive labels for interactive elements
   - Live regions for dynamic updates

2. **Keyboard navigation**:
   - Tab order optimization
   - Skip links for main sections
   - Focus indicators for all interactive elements

3. **Screen reader announcements**:
   - Chart summaries in sr-only text
   - Filter status announcements
   - Loading state notifications

### Phase 6: Mobile Optimizations
1. **Responsive accordion behavior**:
   - Single expanded section on mobile
   - Tap-to-expand with clear indicators
   - Swipe gestures for section navigation

2. **Touch-friendly controls**:
   - Larger tap targets (min 44x44px)
   - Remove hover-dependent features
   - Simplified interactions

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Keep existing tab navigation for Top Files (it works well)
- Ensure all features work without JavaScript
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Performance budget: First paint < 1s, Interactive < 3s

## Testing Approach
1. Accessibility audit with axe-core
2. Performance testing with Lighthouse
3. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. Mobile device testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
5. Keyboard-only navigation testing
6. Screen reader testing

## Small Commits Plan
1. ✅ Add hero strip with key metrics
2. ✅ Implement sticky navigation sidebar
3. ✅ Convert first section to accordion (Overview)
4. ✅ Add localStorage for accordion states
5. ✅ Convert remaining sections to accordions
6. Implement lazy loading for charts
7. Add ARIA labels and roles
8. Optimize keyboard navigation
9. Mobile-specific enhancements
10. Performance optimizations and final polish
