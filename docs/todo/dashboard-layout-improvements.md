# Dashboard Layout and Readability Improvements

Based on common dashboard design best practices, the current HTML report is cluttered and difficult to parse. This document outlines a series of improvements to enhance the layout, readability, and overall user experience.

## Key Improvement Areas

### 1. Layout and Structure

-   **Establish a Clear Visual Hierarchy:**
    -   Adopt a grid-based layout to organize charts and data points logically.
    -   Place the most important, high-level information (e.g., key project stats, overall churn) at the top.
    -   Group related charts together under clear, descriptive headings (e.g., "File Analysis", "Contributor Activity").
-   **Improve Spacing and Flow:**
    -   Increase white space between elements to reduce clutter and improve readability.
    -   Use cards or containers to visually separate distinct sections of the report.

### 2. Data Visualization

-   **Chart Selection and Clarity:**
    -   Review all charts to ensure they are the most effective type for the data being presented.
    -   Ensure all charts have clear titles, labels, and legends.
-   **Color Palette and Consistency:**
    -   Implement a consistent and accessible color palette across all charts.
    -   Use color to highlight key information, not just for decoration.

### 3. Interactivity

-   **Global Filtering:**
    -   Introduce global filters at the top of the report (e.g., date range, author) that apply to all relevant charts.
-   **Cross-Filtering:**
    -   Implement cross-filtering, where clicking on a data point in one chart filters other charts on the dashboard (as described in the file-type-chart-filtering.md feature).

### 4. Typography and Readability

-   **Consistent Fonts and Sizing:**
    -   Use a consistent and readable font throughout the report.
    -   Establish a clear typographic hierarchy (e.g., headings, subheadings, body text) to guide the user's eye.

## Proposed Action Plan

1.  **Create a new CSS stylesheet** to define the improved layout, typography, and color scheme.
2.  **Refactor the HTML template** to use a grid-based layout and incorporate the new CSS classes.
3.  **Update the chart generation logic** to use the new color palette and improve chart-level titles and labels.
4.  **Implement global and cross-filtering** functionality using JavaScript.
