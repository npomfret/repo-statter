# Unused Renderer File

## Problem
- **Location**: `src/report/renderer.ts` (entire file)
- **Description**: This file appears to be unused - it's not imported anywhere in the codebase and contains duplicate functions
- **Current vs Expected**: Unused file exists vs file deleted or properly integrated

## Solution
Since this file contains duplicate functions and ApexCharts rendering logic that's already implemented in the HTML template, delete the entire file:

```bash
rm src/report/renderer.ts
```

## Impact
- **Type**: Pure refactoring
- **Risk**: Low (file is unused)
- **Complexity**: Simple
- **Benefit**: Quick win - removes dead code

## Implementation Notes
Before deletion, verify that no other files import from this module. The chart rendering logic is already implemented in the HTML template in `src/report/generator.ts`.

## Analysis and Validation
✅ **Confirmed unused**: Searched codebase for imports/references to `renderer.ts` - only found references in todo files
✅ **Confirmed duplicate**: The file contains ApexCharts rendering functions that duplicate functionality already in the HTML template
✅ **Safe to delete**: No imports, no references, no dependencies

## Implementation Plan
This is a simple task that can be completed in a single commit:

1. **Verify current state**: Double-check no imports exist
2. **Delete file**: Remove `src/report/renderer.ts`
3. **Verify build**: Ensure deletion doesn't break anything
4. **Commit**: Single commit with clear message about removing dead code

**Risk**: Very low - file is completely unused
**Time**: ~5 minutes
**Complexity**: Trivial deletion task

This task is ready for implementation.
