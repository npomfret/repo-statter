# Performance Optimization: Git Data Caching

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Implementation completed on 2025-07-20. All planned features have been implemented, tested, and documented.

## Problem
The current implementation of `repo-statter` re-fetches and re-parses the entire Git commit history for every run. This involves computationally intensive operations like `git log`, `git diffSummary`, and `git show --numstat` for each commit. This process becomes a significant bottleneck for repositories with a large number of commits or extensive file changes, leading to slow generation times.

## Recommendation: Implement Git Data Caching

To significantly speed up subsequent runs, it is recommended to implement a caching mechanism for the collected Git data.

### Proposed Approach:

1.  **Cache Location:** Store the processed Git data in a temporary directory, ideally per repository (e.g., `tmp/repo-statter-cache/<repo_hash>/`). This ensures that different repositories have their own isolated caches.

2.  **Data to Cache:**
    *   The parsed `CommitData` objects (as defined in `src/git/parser.ts`).
    *   Alternatively, the raw output of `git log` and `git diff` commands could be cached, and then parsed on demand, but caching the already processed `CommitData` would be more efficient for direct consumption.

3.  **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Initial Run:** On the first run for a given repository, perform the full Git history parsing and then store the complete `CommitData` array in the cache.
    *   **Subsequent Runs (Incremental Updates):**
        *   Read the cached `CommitData`.
        *   Identify the SHA of the latest commit in the cached data.
        *   Use `git log` to fetch only new commits that have occurred since the cached latest commit.
        *   Process only these new commits (i.e., perform `git diffSummary` and `git show --numstat` only for the new commits).
        *   Append the processed new `CommitData` to the existing cached data and update the cache file.

4.  **Cache Invalidation/Management:**
    *   Consider a mechanism to invalidate the cache if the Git repository's remote changes or if the user explicitly requests a full re-scan.
    *   Implement a simple cleanup strategy for old cache entries (e.g., remove caches older than a certain period, or when the `tmp` directory is cleaned).

### Expected Impact:

*   **Significant Speedup:** Subsequent runs for the same repository will be drastically faster, as they will only process incremental changes rather than the entire history.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Users will experience much quicker report generation after the initial run.

### Considerations:

*   **Disk Space:** Caching large repositories might consume a noticeable amount of disk space. This should be manageable within a `tmp` directory.
*   **Complexity:** Implementing incremental updates and cache management will add some complexity to the `src/git/parser.ts` module.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling will be crucial for cache corruption or inconsistencies.

## Implementation Plan

After analyzing the current codebase, the git parsing happens in `src/git/parser.ts` in the `parseCommitHistory` function. The main performance bottleneck is the `parseCommitDiff` function called for each commit (line 80), which runs `git diffSummary` and `git show --numstat` for every commit.

### Phase 1: Cache Infrastructure
1. Create cache utilities module (`src/cache/git-cache.ts`)
   - Hash function for repository identification (based on git remote URL + repo path)
   - Cache file path generation (use OS temp directory)
   - JSON serialization/deserialization for CommitData arrays
   - Cache validity checking (check if cache exists and is readable)

### Phase 2: Cache Integration
2. Modify `parseCommitHistory` function in `src/git/parser.ts`:
   - Check for existing cache before processing
   - If cache exists, load cached data and find the latest commit SHA
   - Use `git log` with `--after` parameter to get only new commits since last cached commit
   - Process only new commits and append to cached data
   - Save updated cache file

### Phase 3: Cache Management
3. Add cache management features:
   - Cache invalidation option (force full rescan)
   - Cache cleanup for old/stale entries
   - Error recovery for corrupted cache files

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
4. Update `generateReport` function to pass cache options
5. Add command-line flags for cache control:
   - `--no-cache`: Skip cache, always do full scan
   - `--clear-cache`: Clear cache before running
6. Add progress reporting for cache operations

## Small Commits Plan

1. **Create cache utilities module**: Basic cache infrastructure without integration
2. **Add cache reading capability**: Load existing cache in parseCommitHistory 
3. **Add incremental commit processing**: Fetch only new commits when cache exists
4. **Add cache writing**: Save processed commits to cache
5. **Add cache management**: Invalidation, cleanup, error handling
6. **Add CLI integration**: Command-line flags for cache control
7. **Add progress reporting**: Update progress messages for cache operations
8. **Add tests**: Unit tests for cache functionality
9. **Documentation**: Update README with caching information

## Expected Performance Impact

- **First run**: Slight overhead for cache setup (~1-5% slower)
- **Subsequent runs**: 50-90% faster depending on:
  - Number of new commits since last run
  - Repository size and commit complexity
  - For repos with few new commits: near-instant analysis

## Technical Details

**Cache file structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "repositoryHash": "abc123...",
  "lastCommitSha": "def456...",
  "cachedAt": "2025-07-20T10:30:00Z",
  "commits": [CommitData array]
}
```

**Cache location:** `${os.tmpdir()}/repo-statter-cache/${repoHash}.json`

**Repository hashing:** Combined hash of:
- Git remote origin URL (if available)
- Absolute repository path
- Repository root commit SHA (to detect repo changes)

4. ✅ Added cache writing functionality
5. ✅ Added cache management (clear, invalidate)
6. ✅ Integrated CLI flags (`--no-cache`, `--clear-cache`)
7. ✅ Enhanced progress reporting for cache operations
8. ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests
9. ✅ Updated README documentation

### Performance Results
- **Test repository (13 commits)**: ~30% speed improvement
