# Feature: File Type Chart Filtering and Section Heading

## Description

When a user clicks on a segment in the "File Types" chart, the following charts should be filtered to display data only for the selected file type:

-   "Largest Files"
-   "Most Churn"
-   "Most Complex"

Additionally, this group of charts requires a clear and descriptive heading to improve user understanding.
