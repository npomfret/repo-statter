# Phase 2: HTML Report Scaffolding

## Implementation Plan

**Selected Task: Step 5 - Create Report Template**

### Detailed Implementation Steps
1. **Create directory structure** - Create `src/report/` directory
2. **Create template.html file** - Basic HTML skeleton with Bootstrap and ApexCharts CDN links
3. **Design professional layout** - Using Bootstrap grid system with:
   - Main header with repository name and generation date
   - Key stats cards row 
   - Main content area with chart containers

### Technical Details
- Use Bootstrap 5 for modern, responsive design
- Include ApexCharts via CDN for charting capabilities
- Create placeholder sections for dynamic content injection
- Follow semantic HTML structure
- Keep it minimal and elegant per project guidelines

### Commit Strategy
Single focused commit: "Add HTML report template with Bootstrap and ApexCharts"

### Files to Create
- `src/report/template.html` (new file)

### Next Steps After This Task
- Step 6: Design Report Layout (expand the template)
- Later: Data injection logic to populate the template

*   **Step 5: Create Report Template:**
    *   Create a directory `src/report`.
    *   Inside `src/report`, create a file named `template.html`.
    *   This file will be the skeleton of our final report.
    *   Include ApexCharts and Bootstrap via CDN in the `<head>` for simplicity.

*   **Step 6: Design Report Layout:**
    *   Use Bootstrap's grid system in `template.html` to create a professional layout.
    *   **Layout Idea:**
        *   A main header with the repository name and report generation date.
        *   A row of "Key Stats" cards (e.g., Total Commits, Total Lines of Code, Top Contributor).
        *   A main content area with multiple chart containers.
