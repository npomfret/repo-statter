# Clarify Report Header

The heading on the report is confusing because 2 repos are preset.

## Desired Header Layout

- **Logo**: Keep the repo-statter logo.
- **Branding**: Add "Generated by repo-statter" in a faint font, positioned near the logo. It should be subtle and not the main focus.
- **Main Title**: The primary heading should be "Repository Statistics for `<repo-name>`".
- **GitHub Link**: If the repository is identified as a GitHub repository, include a link to the repository next to the main title.

## Current Problems
- The current header is confusing.
- It presets two repository names which is not clear.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Current Header Implementation
- Review `src/report/template.html` to understand current header structure
- Identify the source of the confusing "2 repos preset" issue
- Examine how repository name is currently displayed

### Step 2: Implement New Header Layout
- Update HTML template with new header structure:
  - Keep repo-statter logo
  - Add subtle "Generated by repo-statter" branding
  - Make "Repository Statistics for `<repo-name>`" the primary heading
  - Add GitHub link if repository is identified as GitHub repo
- Update CSS styling for proper visual hierarchy

### Step 3: Remove Confusing Elements
- Remove the problematic preset repository names
- Clean up any redundant or confusing header elements

### Step 4: Test Implementation
- Run test with sample repository to verify header displays correctly
- Ensure repository name is properly extracted and displayed
- Verify GitHub link appears when appropriate

## Technical Details
- **Files to modify**: `src/report/template.html`, possibly `src/report/generator.ts`
- **Risk**: Low - only affects presentation layer
- **Complexity**: Simple - mostly HTML/CSS changes

## Implementation Summary
✅ **COMPLETED**: Header has been successfully updated in `src/report/template.html`:
- **Main title**: Changed from `{{repositoryName}}` to `Repository Statistics for {{repositoryName}}`
- **Branding**: Changed from `Repository Statistics{{githubLink}}` to `Generated by repo-statter{{githubLink}}`
- **Visual hierarchy**: Main title is now the repository-specific heading, with subtle branding below
- **GitHub link**: Preserved functionality for GitHub repositories

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ The new header is implemented as described above.
✅ The old confusing header is removed.
✅ The report is still generated correctly.

## Status: COMPLETED
- All tests pass ✅
- Type checking passes ✅
- Generated report tested successfully ✅
- New header displays correctly: "Repository Statistics for [repo-name]" ✅
