# Clarify Report Header

The heading on the report is confusing because 2 repos are preset.

## Desired Header Layout

- **Logo**: Keep the repo-statter logo.
- **Branding**: Add "Generated by repo-statter" in a faint font, positioned near the logo. It should be subtle and not the main focus.
- **Main Title**: The primary heading should be "Repository Statistics for `<repo-name>`".
- **GitHub Link**: If the repository is identified as a GitHub repository, include a link to the repository next to the main title.

## Current Problems
- The current header is confusing.
- It presets two repository names which is not clear.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The new header is implemented as described above.
- The old confusing header is removed.
- The report is still generated correctly.
