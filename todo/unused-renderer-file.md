# Unused Renderer File

## Problem
- **Location**: `src/report/renderer.ts` (entire file)
- **Description**: This file appears to be unused - it's not imported anywhere in the codebase and contains duplicate functions
- **Current vs Expected**: Unused file exists vs file deleted or properly integrated

## Solution
Since this file contains duplicate functions and ApexCharts rendering logic that's already implemented in the HTML template, delete the entire file:

```bash
rm src/report/renderer.ts
```

## Impact
- **Type**: Pure refactoring
- **Risk**: Low (file is unused)
- **Complexity**: Simple
- **Benefit**: Quick win - removes dead code

## Implementation Notes
Before deletion, verify that no other files import from this module. The chart rendering logic is already implemented in the HTML template in `src/report/generator.ts`.
