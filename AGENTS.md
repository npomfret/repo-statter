# COMMAND-FIRST WORKFLOW

## 🚀 Start EVERY Request with `/p`

The `/p` meta-prompt command automatically selects the best tools for your task:

```
/p analyze performance issues in my React app
/p fix the login bug in issue #123
/p refactor this code for better types
/p add dark mode to settings
```

## Why `/p`?

- **Zero Memory Load**: No need to remember tool names
- **Optimal Workflows**: Always uses the best combination of tools
- **Learning Aid**: Shows you which tools are selected and why
- **Can't Be Ignored**: Explicit command vs passive instructions

## Available Tools

**View all tools:**
- `/mcp-list` - See MCP servers (fast operations)
- `/agent-list` - See subagents (quality enforcement)

**Direct usage (optional):**
- MCP servers: `mcp__servername__method`
- Subagents: "Use the [agent-name] agent"

## The `/p` Advantage

Instead of:
- Remembering dozens of tool names
- Figuring out the right sequence
- Missing optimal approaches

Just use `/p` and get:
- Intelligent tool selection
- Proper sequencing
- Best practices enforced

## Examples of `/p` in Action

**Feature Development:**
```
/p add user authentication to the app
→ architect-advisor → MCP tools → quality agents → test-runner → auditor
```

**Bug Fixing:**
```
/p fix TypeError in user.service.ts line 45
→ architect-advisor → mcp__typescript-mcp__ → fix → test-runner → auditor
```

**Analysis:**
```
/p analyze bundle size and suggest optimizations
→ mcp__context-provider__ → mcp__typescript-mcp__ → analyst agent
```

## Remember

- **ALWAYS** start with `/p` for intelligent assistance
- The first `/p` in a session initializes MCP context
- Each `/p` returns an enhanced prompt with optimal tool usage
- Follow the enhanced prompt for best results

## Scope

Do what was asked, and nothing more. Work that was invented rather than requested is why a task never reaches an end.

### Never invent work

- Never invent a requirement. If the request does not state it and the project does not already require it, it is not a requirement.
- Never widen the scope of a change. The request sets the boundary; a related file, a neighbouring function or a second caller is outside it unless the change cannot work without them.
- Never start adjacent work you thought of yourself: a refactor you noticed, a test you would like to exist, a rename, a tidy-up, a dependency bump, a doc you would have written differently. "While I was in there" is not a reason.
- Never invent edge cases or failure scenarios. Before adding special handling, a fallback or a test for one, cite evidence that it exists: observed data, an actual incident, or a reproducible failure. "It could happen" is not evidence.
- Never treat a suggestion the user has not answered as approval. Silence is not yes, and neither is a suggestion you made yourself.

### Suggest instead

- Noticing work is not permission to do it. Say what you noticed in one line, and stop.
- Put suggestions at the end of the report, after what was actually done, and keep them separate from it so the two are never confused.
- One line each. A suggestion that needs a paragraph is a proposal, and a proposal is asked about before it is written, not after.
- Ask when the request is ambiguous. Do not resolve an ambiguity by building both sides, by building the larger one, or by building the one you find more interesting.

### Finish what was asked

This is not licence to stop early, and scope discipline is not an excuse for leaving something broken.

- A change is finished when what was asked works and has been verified — not when nothing more can be thought of, and not when the first part of it compiles.
- Work the change makes necessary is inside the scope, not outside it: a caller the new signature breaks, a test the change invalidates, a migration the schema now needs. Doing that is finishing the job, not expanding it.
- If the requested change cannot be made without work that was not requested, say so and wait. Do not do it silently, and do not abandon the request because of it.
- Report what was done and what was verified. Do not report intentions, or work you decided against.
