# COMMAND-FIRST WORKFLOW

## 🚀 Start EVERY Request with `/p`

The `/p` meta-prompt command automatically selects the best tools for your task:

```
/p analyze performance issues in my React app
/p fix the login bug in issue #123
/p refactor this code for better types
/p add dark mode to settings
```

## Why `/p`?

- **Zero Memory Load**: No need to remember tool names
- **Optimal Workflows**: Always uses the best combination of tools
- **Learning Aid**: Shows you which tools are selected and why
- **Can't Be Ignored**: Explicit command vs passive instructions

## Available Tools

**View all tools:**
- `/mcp-list` - See MCP servers (fast operations)
- `/agent-list` - See subagents (quality enforcement)

**Direct usage (optional):**
- MCP servers: `mcp__servername__method`
- Subagents: "Use the [agent-name] agent"

## The `/p` Advantage

Instead of:
- Remembering dozens of tool names
- Figuring out the right sequence
- Missing optimal approaches

Just use `/p` and get:
- Intelligent tool selection
- Proper sequencing
- Best practices enforced

## Examples of `/p` in Action

**Feature Development:**
```
/p add user authentication to the app
→ architect-advisor → MCP tools → quality agents → test-runner → auditor
```

**Bug Fixing:**
```
/p fix TypeError in user.service.ts line 45
→ architect-advisor → mcp__typescript-mcp__ → fix → test-runner → auditor
```

**Analysis:**
```
/p analyze bundle size and suggest optimizations
→ mcp__context-provider__ → mcp__typescript-mcp__ → analyst agent
```

## Remember

- **ALWAYS** start with `/p` for intelligent assistance
- The first `/p` in a session initializes MCP context
- Each `/p` returns an enhanced prompt with optimal tool usage
- Follow the enhanced prompt for best results

## Task files

A `tasks/` folder holds one markdown file per piece of work. This is our standard workflow and the wording is identical across all our projects. Task files are committed with the code.

### When a task file is required

- Always, for planned work.
- For unplanned work, whenever a reasonable-length commit message could not adequately describe the problem, the solution and the evidence. If a commit message is enough, no task file is needed.
- One file per piece of work. If an existing task already owns the work, update it instead of creating another.

### Naming and location

- `<slug>.md` inside a `tasks/` folder. The slug is a short imperative description in plain search terms, for example `fix-login-timeout.md` or `add-csv-export.md`. A numeric or stream prefix is fine where the project already uses one.
- A `tasks/` folder need not be at the repository root. Where a project is split into sub-projects, each may keep its own `tasks/` folder owning the work for its code, and a root `tasks/` then covers work that crosses sub-projects or concerns the repository itself. Put the file in the `tasks/` folder closest to the code it changes.
- Subfolders inside `tasks/` may group related work.
- Non-task documentation goes in `docs/`, not `tasks/`.

### What goes in a task file

A task file grows with the work. It may begin as nothing more than a bug report or a one-line feature request, and at that point it is complete. Add a section when the work produces something to put under it; never write a heading you have nothing to fill.

Only the issue is always present:

- The issue: the bug, feature, refactor or research question, and why it matters.
- Brainstorming: candidate approaches, including rejected ones and why they were rejected.
- The plan: the chosen solution, broken into steps or phases that each leave the system working, with observable success criteria.
- Tracking: current status, decisions and approvals, what has shipped, what remains, blockers, the exact verification run, and residual risk.

### Keeping it current

- A task file is a living working document, not a diary. Correct stale scope, plans and claims in place. Do not append a chronological log of changes of mind; git history records that.
- Update the task file in the same commit as the code it describes so status and implementation never drift.
- Mark a step complete only when the implementation exists and its verification has passed. If verification cannot run, leave the step open and record the exact blocker.

### Completion and deletion

- A task file is not an authority, and code and durable docs must never reference one.
- Usually nothing needs promoting before deletion. The work is the code, the tests are the evidence, and both stay. Delete the file.
- Occasionally a task reaches a conclusion the code cannot carry: a product or architecture decision, or an approach rejected for reasons worth not rediscovering. Move that to `docs/` first. This is the exception, not the rule.
- The commit that lands the last piece of work also updates the task file to its final state: what shipped, exact verification, remaining risk.
- Delete the completed task file in a separate follow-up commit, after that last piece of work is committed. Genuinely outstanding work moves to a new, narrower task file first.
